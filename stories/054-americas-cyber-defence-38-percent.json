  "content": "The Department of Homeland Security shut down on February 14th. Nobody noticed for a week.\n\nNow the consequences are arriving.\n\n**CISA \u2014 the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency** \u2014 is America's front line against cyberattacks. It protects federal networks, coordinates threat response, runs vulnerability scanning.\n\n## 38% | The percentage of CISA staff currently working\n\n888 out of 2,341 employees are designated \"excepted.\" The rest are furloughed. Not fired \u2014 frozen. No pay, no work.\n\nIn January 2025, CISA had 3,400 employees. **A third were already gone before the shutdown.**\n\n>> \"CISA is maintaining incident response and threat coordination but scaling back vulnerability scanning.\" \u2014 GovInfoSecurity\n\nVulnerability scanning. That's the thing that finds holes before hackers do. It's the thing they stopped doing.\n\nNo Senate-confirmed leader. No full staff. No funding. And the threat environment hasn't taken a day off.\n\n!! The government shut down its cyber agency during the largest wave of state-sponsored hacking in a decade. Read that sentence again.",
