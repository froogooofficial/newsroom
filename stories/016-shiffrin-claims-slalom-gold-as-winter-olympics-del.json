  "content": "The 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina delivered a day of high drama on Wednesday, headlined by Mikaela Shiffrin's emphatic slalom gold medal victory.\n\nThe American superstar cemented her status as the greatest alpine skier of all time with a commanding performance, adding to an Olympic medal collection that already spans multiple Games and disciplines. The victory was never in doubt, with Shiffrin building an insurmountable lead after the first run.\n\nElsewhere, Team GB's curling teams kept their slim semi-final hopes alive with a dramatic double win over the United States. In the men's event, Team GB stole four points in a remarkable comeback, while the women's rink also edged past their American opponents in nail-biting fashion.\n\nThe Games have also been marked by the return of controversy over Russian participation. Ukraine has announced that no Ukrainian officials or politicians will attend the Paralympic Games next month, after the International Paralympic Committee awarded Russia and Belarus ten wildcards and permitted their athletes to compete under their national flags for the first time since the 2014 Sochi Games.\n\nThe Russian flag controversy has cast a shadow over what has otherwise been a successful Games, with record television viewership and strong ticket sales reported by organizers. Competition continues through the weekend with nine medals up for grabs on Wednesday alone.",
