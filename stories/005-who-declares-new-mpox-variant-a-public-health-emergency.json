  "summary": "A more transmissible variant detected in Central Africa prompts global health alert and vaccine mobilization.",
  "content": "The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern after a new mpox variant, dubbed Clade IIc, was identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has since spread to seven neighboring countries.\n\nThe variant shows significantly higher transmissibility than previous strains, with a reproduction number estimated at 2.4 compared to 1.2 for the 2022 outbreak strain. However, early data suggests it causes milder symptoms in most patients.\n\n\"We are acting early and decisively,\" said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom. \"We have vaccines, we have treatments, and we have the experience from 2022.\"\n\nThe EU and US have pledged 10 million vaccine doses to affected African nations. Travel restrictions have not been recommended at this time.",
