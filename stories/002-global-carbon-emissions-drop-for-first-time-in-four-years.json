  "summary": "A surprise decline driven by renewable energy expansion in China and India gives climate scientists cautious optimism.",
  "content": "Global carbon dioxide emissions fell by 1.2% in 2024, the first annual decline since 2020, according to new data from the Global Carbon Project.\n\nThe drop was primarily driven by a massive expansion of solar and wind capacity in China, which added 300 GW of renewable energy \u2014 more than the entire installed capacity of Germany. India also contributed with a 45% increase in solar installations.\n\nHowever, scientists caution that a single year of decline does not constitute a trend. \"We need sustained, accelerating reductions of 7-10% per year to meet Paris Agreement targets,\" said Dr. Elena Rodriguez of the Potsdam Institute.\n\nThe transportation sector remains the biggest challenge, with aviation emissions continuing to rise as post-pandemic travel demand grows.",
