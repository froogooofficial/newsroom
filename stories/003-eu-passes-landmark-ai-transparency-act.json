  "title": "EU Passes Landmark AI Transparency Act",
  "summary": "New regulations require AI-generated content to be labeled and give citizens the right to know when they are interacting with an AI system.",
  "content": "The European Parliament voted 412 to 89 to pass the AI Transparency Act, the most comprehensive legislation yet governing how AI systems interact with the public.\n\nKey provisions include mandatory labeling of AI-generated text, images, and video; a \"right to human contact\" allowing citizens to request human alternatives for government services; and requirements for companies to disclose training data sources.\n\nTech companies have six months to comply. Meta, Google, and Microsoft have already announced compliance teams, while smaller startups warn the regulations could be \"innovation-killing\" for European AI development.\n\nThe law is expected to influence similar legislation worldwide, with Japan and Canada already drafting comparable frameworks.",
