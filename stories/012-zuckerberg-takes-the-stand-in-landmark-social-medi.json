  "content": "Mark Zuckerberg arrived at a California courtroom on Wednesday to testify in what may be the most consequential trial the social media industry has ever faced.\n\nThe Meta CEO is taking the stand for the first time before a jury in a case centered on whether Instagram is addictively designed and harmful to children. The plaintiff, a teenager identified by her initials K.G.M., claims Instagram caused her psychological harm.\n\nMeta's lawyers have argued that the girl's problems stemmed from other factors in her life, not her Instagram use. But the broader implications are enormous: this Los Angeles trial, in which Google's YouTube is also a defendant, is being closely watched as a bellwether for thousands of similar lawsuits facing social media companies.\n\nThe trial tests a fundamental question that regulators, parents, and lawmakers have been wrestling with for years: can social media platforms be held legally responsible for the mental health impact of their products on young users?\n\nFor Zuckerberg, the courtroom appearance represents a dramatic shift. After years of facing congressional hearings and regulatory scrutiny with the comfortable buffer of corporate lawyers and prepared statements, he now faces cross-examination under oath before ordinary jurors.\n\nThe outcome could set precedents affecting how social media companies design their products, what safeguards they implement for minors, and how much liability they bear when those safeguards fail.",
