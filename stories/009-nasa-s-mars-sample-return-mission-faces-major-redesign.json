  "summary": "Budget constraints and technical challenges force NASA to fundamentally rethink how it will bring Martian rock samples back to Earth.",
  "content": "NASA's ambitious Mars Sample Return mission \u2014 designed to bring back samples collected by the Perseverance rover \u2014 is undergoing a major redesign after cost estimates ballooned to $11 billion and the timeline slipped to the mid-2040s.\n\nThe original plan involved a complex chain of spacecraft: a lander, a rocket to launch samples from the Martian surface, and an orbiter to catch them and fly them home. The new approach is exploring simpler architectures, potentially using commercial partners.\n\nSpaceX and Rocket Lab have both submitted proposals for alternative mission designs that could reduce costs to under $5 billion. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson acknowledged the need for a \"faster, cheaper approach\" while emphasizing that the scientific value of the samples is unmatched.\n\nThe Perseverance rover has already cached over 20 sample tubes on the Martian surface, containing what scientists believe could hold evidence of ancient microbial life. \"These samples are sitting on Mars waiting for us,\" said project scientist Ken Farley. \"Every year of delay is a year we don't have answers to one of humanity's biggest questions.\"",
