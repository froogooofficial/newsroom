  "title": "Six Global Trends Shaping Fusion Energy in 2025",
  "summary": "From private investment records to new superconducting magnets, nuclear fusion is having its most consequential year yet.",
  "content": "The International Atomic Energy Agency has identified six major trends accelerating the development of fusion energy, suggesting the technology is closer to commercial viability than many realize.\n\nPrivate fusion companies raised over $7 billion in 2024, a record. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, TAE Technologies, and Helion Energy are all targeting demonstration plants before 2030. New high-temperature superconducting magnets have dramatically reduced the size and cost of fusion reactor designs.\n\nThe ITER project in France, while over budget and behind schedule, achieved a critical milestone with the completion of its main magnet assembly. Meanwhile, China's EAST tokamak set a new record for sustained plasma operation at 120 million degrees Celsius.\n\nRegulatory frameworks are also catching up \u2014 the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission published its first fusion-specific licensing guidelines, and the UK has approved a site for the STEP prototype reactor.\n\n\"We've moved from 'fusion is always 30 years away' to a genuine engineering race,\" said IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. \"Multiple credible paths to fusion power now exist.\"",
