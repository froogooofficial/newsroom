  "summary": "The CDC has expanded surveillance of the H5N1 bird flu virus after detecting increased spillover events from dairy cattle to farm workers.",
  "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced expanded monitoring of the H5N1 avian influenza virus after the number of human cases linked to dairy cattle outbreaks rose to 67 across 12 states.\n\nWhile no sustained human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, the virus has shown concerning mutations in several recent samples that could enhance its ability to bind to human respiratory cells.\n\n\"We are not in a pandemic situation, but we are in a phase that requires heightened vigilance,\" said CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen. \"The virus is evolving, and we need to stay ahead of it.\"\n\nThe USDA has confirmed H5N1 infections in dairy herds across 15 states. Farm workers who handle infected cattle are being offered antiviral prophylaxis and closely monitored. A candidate vaccine has been manufactured and stockpiled.\n\nThe outbreak has already impacted egg and poultry prices, with some regions seeing 30-40% increases. Major poultry producers have implemented strict biosecurity measures, including restricting worker movement between facilities.",
