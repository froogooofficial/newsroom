  "content": "A new analysis from the Stimson Center reconstructs the tense four days in May 2025 when India and Pakistan found themselves on the brink of military conflict following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe crisis began when militants attacked an Indian military convoy, killing 14 soldiers.
