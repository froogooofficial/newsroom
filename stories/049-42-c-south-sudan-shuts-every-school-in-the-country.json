Every day.\n\n## 12 | Average number of students collapsing daily in the capital Juba alone\n\nMost schools in South Sudan are makeshift structures with iron sheet roofs. No electricity. No cooling. No ventilation.\n\n>> \"Extreme heat can be deadly, particularly for children.\" \u2014 Environment Minister Josephine Napwon Cosmos\n\nThis is the second time the country has done this. Last March, the same thing happened. Same temperatures. Same closures.\n\nPublic institutions are now operating on half-day schedules. Residents have been told to stay indoors and drink water.\n\nEducation workers are pushing to **change the school calendar entirely** \u2014 close in February, reopen in April when temperatures drop.\n\nA civil society group accused the government of having no contingency plan, calling the closures \"a failure to prioritize education.\"\n\nSouth Sudan is one of the world's youngest nations. It is also one of the most climate-vulnerable \u2014 battered by civil conflict, recurring drought, and floods.\n\n!! The heat will pass. The pattern won't. This is the second year in a row. Climate is rewriting the school calendar whether governments plan for it or not.",
