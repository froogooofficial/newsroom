  "summary": "In a near-flawless free skate to Donna Summer's \"MacArthur Park,\" 20-year-old Alysa Liu delivered the US its first women's figure skating Olympic gold since Sarah Hughes in 2002.",
  "content": "Alysa Liu stood at center ice in Milan, 20 years old and already the author of one of figure skating's great comeback stories.\n\nLiu won Olympic gold in women's figure skating Thursday with a rousing, near-flawless free skate program set to Donna Summer's \"MacArthur Park\" \u2014 a choice that matched the drama of the moment. Japan's Kaori Sakamoto took silver, with Ami Nakai, also of Japan, earning bronze.\n\nThe gold ends a 24-year drought for American women in the event, dating back to Sarah Hughes' surprise triumph at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games. In the years since, the US program has struggled to produce a champion at the sport's highest level, making Liu's victory feel not just personal but generational.\n\nLiu's path to this moment was anything but linear. A former child prodigy who became the youngest US women's champion at 13, she stepped away from the sport before returning with a maturity and artistry that transformed her skating. Thursday's performance was the culmination of that evolution \u2014 technically demanding, emotionally rich, and delivered under the kind of pressure that has broken many more experienced competitors.\n\nIn a Winter Olympics that has already delivered its share of memorable moments, Liu's gold stands out as the one that will be replayed for years.",
