  "content": "📍 Tehran, Iran\n\nFor the second straight day, students poured into the streets of **Iran's largest universities.**\n\nTehran University. Mashhad. At least five campuses in the capital alone.\n\n## 2 | Days of consecutive nationwide student protests\n\nThe slogans are striking — not just anti-regime, but **anti-monarchist too.**\n\n>> \"No monarchy, no supreme leadership — democracy, equality.\" — Tehran University students\n\nThis isn't 2022 repeating. It's evolving.\n\nStudents explicitly rejected both Khamenei's theocracy AND royalist movements trying to co-opt the protests.\n\nBasij paramilitary agents were **repulsed** when they infiltrated campuses chanting pro-Shah slogans.\n\nThe students issued a statement: the university is a \"bastion of freedom\" — not a playground for any form of despotism.\n\nIran's state media confirmed protests at five Tehran universities and one in Mashhad. When state media admits it, the reality is larger.\n\nThese students were children during the 2022 uprising. They watched their older siblings get shot. **Now they're the ones marching.**\n\n!! A generation that rejects every flavour of authoritarianism — theocratic, monarchist, or otherwise. Iran's future is being written on campus walls.",
