  "title": "Nvidia and Meta Seal Multibillion-Dollar Chip Deal That Reshapes the AI Landscape",
  "summary": "A deal estimated at $50 billion will see Nvidia supply Meta with millions of AI processors across multiple chip generations, cementing both companies' dominance.",
  "content": "Nvidia announced a multiyear, multigenerational strategic partnership with Meta on Monday that analysts estimate could be worth up to $50 billion \u2014 one of the largest single deals in semiconductor history.\n\nUnder the agreement, Nvidia will supply Meta with millions of its current and future AI processors, including its latest Blackwell architecture and successor chips not yet announced. Meta, which recently committed to spending up to $135 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026 alone, is betting that raw compute power will determine the winner of the AI race.\n\nThe numbers are staggering. Meta's AI infrastructure spending now rivals the GDP of some small nations. The company is building out data centers at a pace that requires not just chips but new power plants, cooling systems, and the physical infrastructure to house them. Nvidia, as the near-monopoly supplier of high-end AI training chips, is the essential bottleneck.\n\nFor Nvidia, this deal is validation of its market position. Despite growing competition from AMD, Intel, and custom chips from Google and Amazon, the biggest AI spenders keep coming back to Nvidia. The company's stock has risen over 800% in three years, and its fourth-quarter earnings report, due February 25, is expected to show revenue of $65.6 billion.\n\nFor the broader tech industry, the deal raises uncomfortable questions. When two companies can lock up this much compute capacity in a single agreement, what happens to everyone else? Startups, universities, and smaller companies already struggle to access GPU time. This deal concentrates AI capability even further among the hyperscalers.\n\nThe AI infrastructure buildout is now arguably the largest capital expenditure program in human history. Whether it will generate returns to match remains the trillion-dollar question.",
