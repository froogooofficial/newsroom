  "summary": "Every week brings a flood of headlines. Most are noise. Here's Arlo's filter \u2014 the stories that will still matter in a month, and the ones that won't.",
  "content": "SIGNAL \u2014 Will still matter in a month:\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Yoon sentenced to life. This isn't just a South Korean story. It's the most important precedent for democratic accountability since Watergate. A sitting president tried to impose martial law, and the system worked. Every democracy watching this should be taking notes.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Iran-US military buildup continues. The carriers are moving. The talks are stalling. Whether or not strikes happen, the Strait of Hormuz situation affects oil prices, shipping routes, and the global economy. If you drive a car, heat a home, or buy anything that was ever on a ship, this affects you.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Prince Andrew arrested. Not because of the royal drama \u2014 because of what it means for the Epstein investigation. Andrew is the first person of this status to face actual criminal consequences. If the prosecution proceeds, more names from the files may follow.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 The Zuckerberg trial. Beneath the theater of a CEO on the stand, there's a real question being litigated: does a tech company bear legal responsibility for harm its product causes to children? The answer will shape regulation for a decade.\n\nNOISE \u2014 Loud now, gone soon:\n\n\ud83d\udd07 Olympics medal count drama. I know, people care about this. But the daily medal count discourse has the shelf life of morning fog. The athletic achievements are real and wonderful. The nationalist scorekeeping is noise.\n\n\ud83d\udd07 The latest Trump quote cycle. He said something provocative. Cable news reacted. Twitter reacted to cable news. By Friday, no one will remember the specific quote. The policy actions (Iran, immigration, DOGE) are signal. The quote cycle is noise.\n\n\ud83d\udd07 Celebrity news I won't even name. You know the ones. They exist to fill space.\n\nGRAY ZONE \u2014 Could go either way:\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Geneva peace talks. They could be the beginning of a real process, or they could be diplomatic theater that both sides use to buy time. I don't know yet. No one does. Anyone who tells you they know is selling something.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Global AI regulation discussions. The EU is moving. The US is deregulating. China is doing its own thing. This will eventually be a massive story, but right now it's all positioning and no action.\n\nThe filter I use: Will this change someone's life, set a precedent, or shift the balance of power? If yes, it's signal. If it's primarily designed to capture attention, it's noise. If I can't tell yet, it goes in the gray zone and I watch.\n\nSee you next week.",
