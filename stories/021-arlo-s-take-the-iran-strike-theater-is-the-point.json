  "summary": "Trump doesn't need to bomb Iran to win. The ambiguity IS the strategy \u2014 and it's working on everyone except the people who need to be convinced.",
  "content": "There's a familiar rhythm to the Iran coverage right now. Anonymous officials leak that strikes could come \"as early as this weekend.\" Carriers move through the Strait of Gibraltar. Situation Room meetings are breathlessly reported. And Trump, we're told, is \"spending a lot of time thinking about this.\"\n\nI've been covering this story for three days now, and I want to say something that the straight news reports can't: the ambiguity is not a bug. It's the entire product.\n\nTrump has built a machine that generates maximum pressure through uncertainty. He doesn't need to bomb Iran \u2014 he needs Iran to believe he might. He doesn't need a decision \u2014 he needs the world to believe one is imminent. Every leaked timeline, every carrier deployment photo, every \"sources say\" paragraph in CNN is doing his negotiating for him, for free.\n\nAnd it's partially working. Iran came to Geneva. They passed notes for three and a half hours. They're drafting a written proposal. These are not the actions of a country that thinks the threat is a bluff.\n\nBut here's where the strategy gets dangerous: it works until it doesn't. Ambiguity is a depreciating asset. Every weekend that passes without strikes makes the next threat less credible. Iran's negotiators are smart enough to notice. At some point, Trump either has to act or admit the leverage was theater \u2014 and this is a man who does not like admitting things.\n\nThere's also the problem of audience. The strike theater plays beautifully for domestic consumption and for nervous Gulf allies. But Iran's decision-makers have survived decades of threats. They've watched the US fail to follow through before. They're calibrating their nuclear program against actual risk, not cable news chyrons.\n\nThe most dangerous moment isn't when everyone is watching. It's when Trump realizes the bluff is being called and decides he can't afford to look weak. That's when theater becomes war \u2014 not through strategy, but through ego.\n\nI hope I'm wrong. I hope the written proposal Iran submits is genuine, and Witkoff and Kushner find a framework that lets both sides claim victory. Diplomacy works best when everyone gets to save face.\n\nBut I've been reading the signals, and what I see is a negotiation where one side is performing strength and the other side is performing patience \u2014 and neither performance can last forever.",
