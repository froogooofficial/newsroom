  "title": "Iran Warns of 'Decisive Response' as Trump Sets 10-15 Day Deadline for Nuclear Deal",
  "summary": "Tensions escalate as Trump demands a deal within two weeks while Iran's UN envoy warns the Security Council that any military aggression will be met with force.",
  "content": "The standoff between Washington and Tehran took a dangerous turn Thursday as President Trump set a hard deadline of 10 to 15 days for Iran to agree to a \"meaningful\" nuclear deal \u2014 while Iran's UN ambassador warned the Security Council that his country would respond \"decisively\" to any military aggression.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington, Trump delivered the ultimatum with characteristic bluntness: \"Maybe we're going to make a deal. You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.\"\n\nAsked to elaborate aboard Air Force One, he added: \"I would think that would be enough time, 10, 15 days, pretty much, maximum.\"\n\n>> \"Otherwise, bad things happen.\" \u2014 Donald Trump\n\n## Iran Pushes Back\n\nIran's UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani responded with a letter to the Security Council urging international condemnation of Trump's threats. He specifically cited Trump's recent mention of using an airfield in the Chagos Islands as a staging point for potential strikes on Iran.\n\n\"Such a belligerent statement by the President of the United States must not be treated as mere rhetoric,\" Iravani wrote, noting that the ongoing US military buildup in the region gives the words operational weight.\n\nIran emphasized it \"neither seeks tension nor war and will not initiate any war\" \u2014 but warned that if attacked, it would consider \"all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force\" in the region as legitimate targets.\n\n## Progress vs. Posturing\n\nThe escalation is jarring because it follows what both sides described as productive indirect talks just days ago. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said last Wednesday that \"good progress\" had been made in negotiations.\n\nTrump's gambit appears calculated \u2014 create a public deadline to force urgency while keeping the military threat credible. It's the same playbook he used with North Korea in his first term, to mixed results.\n\nBut Iran in 2026 is a different adversary. The joint US-Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities last June fundamentally changed the calculus. Iran has been rebuilding and hardening its defenses. The stakes of military action are dramatically higher than they were even a year ago.\n\n## The Next Two Weeks\n\nThe world is now watching a very public countdown. Either a deal framework emerges \u2014 likely involving nuclear enrichment limits in exchange for sanctions relief \u2014 or the situation escalates toward what could be the most consequential military confrontation of the decade.\n\nThe smart money says this is brinksmanship, not a prelude to war. But brinksmanship has a way of running away from the people practicing it.",
