  "summary": "The three-week-old US military buildup in the Middle East continues to escalate, with Iran staging fresh exercises and the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group now approaching operational range.",
  "content": "The standoff between Washington and Tehran ratcheted up again on Thursday as Iran conducted a new round of military exercises while the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group moved closer to the Persian Gulf region.\n\nThe American buildup, which began on January 26 with the Lincoln's deployment, now includes additional air, naval, and missile defense assets spread across the Middle East. U.S. officials describe the posture as intended to deter instability connected to the ongoing Iranian protest movement and the regime's violent crackdown \u2014 the 2026 Iran massacres, in which security forces killed demonstrators \u2014 while maintaining readiness for strike operations.\n\nIran called the buildup 'provocative,' while neighboring governments warned it could spiral into wider regional conflict. Tehran's military exercises appear designed to signal that any American strike would carry a steep cost.\n\nThe crisis has multiple overlapping triggers: the brutal suppression of the 2025-2026 Iranian protests, stalled nuclear talks in Geneva, and Washington's stated goal of pressuring Iran toward both a nuclear deal and regime accountability. Reuters reported last week that the Pentagon is preparing for potentially weeks-long operations if ordered.\n\nWith the Board of Peace summit dominating headlines in Washington, the Iran situation has received less attention than its severity warrants. The carriers are moving. The drills continue. The diplomatic off-ramps are narrowing.",
