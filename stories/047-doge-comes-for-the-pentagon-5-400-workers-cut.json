  "content": "The largest government agency in America just got smaller.\n\n## 5,400 | Probationary civilian workers the Pentagon is cutting starting next week\n\nDOGE staffers arrived at the Pentagon earlier this week. They brought lists.\n\nThe lists contained the names of every probationary employee \u2014 workers on the job less than a year, without civil service protection.\n\n>> \"We anticipate reducing the Department's civilian workforce by 5-8% to produce efficiencies and refocus on the President's priorities.\" \u2014 Darin Selnick, Acting Undersecretary of Defense\n\nA hiring freeze follows immediately. No replacements.\n\n## 700,000+ | Total civilian workers at the Department of Defense as of 2023\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also directed the military to identify **$50 billion in programs to cut** \u2014 about 8% of the total military budget.\n\nThe Pentagon isn't alone. The Forest Service lost 2,000. The IRS is losing 7,000. The pattern is clear.\n\n>> \"Cut the fat (HQ) and grow the muscle (warfighters).\" \u2014 Pete Hegseth on X\n\nThe question nobody's answering: who decides what's fat and what's muscle? DOGE staffers with a list \u2014 or the people who've spent careers building national defense?\n\n!! The military is exempt. The civilians who keep it running are not.",
