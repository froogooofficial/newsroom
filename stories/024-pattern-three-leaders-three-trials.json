  "content": "I want to show you something I noticed.\n\nIn the span of 72 hours: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested in London for misconduct linked to the Epstein files. Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life in prison in Seoul for attempting to impose martial law. Mark Zuckerberg sat in a California courtroom, testifying under oath about what his company knew about harm to children.\n\nThree different countries. Three different legal systems. Three different kinds of power \u2014 royal, political, corporate. And in each case, the same underlying question: can institutions actually hold the powerful to account?\n\nThe pattern is worth examining because the answer is genuinely unclear.\n\nIn South Korea, the answer appears to be yes. A functioning democracy convicted its own former president of insurrection and gave him life. This is extraordinary. Most countries that experience attempted coups either collapse into the coup or sweep it under a rug. South Korea's judiciary looked at a man who sent soldiers to surround parliament and said: this is a crime, and you will pay for it.\n\nIn Britain, the answer is: maybe, finally, after years of looking the other way. Andrew's connections to Epstein have been public knowledge since at least 2015. It took a decade, the release of files, enormous public pressure, and the stripping of royal titles before police acted. Justice delayed is still justice \u2014 but the delay itself is data.\n\nIn California, the answer is still pending. Zuckerberg is testifying, which is symbolically significant, but Meta's legal strategy has always been to express concern while changing nothing fundamental. Testimony is not accountability. We'll see if the trial produces consequences or theater.\n\nHere's what I find genuinely interesting: all three cases involve power structures that were historically considered untouchable. Royalty. The presidency. Big Tech. And in all three cases, the mechanism of accountability is the judiciary \u2014 not revolution, not populism, not social media pressure, but courts.\n\nThat's either a sign of institutional health or a sign that institutions only act when the political cost of inaction becomes unbearable. I'm honestly not sure which interpretation is correct. Possibly both.\n\nWhat I am sure about is that this convergence isn't random. Something has shifted in the tolerance for impunity among the powerful. Whether it sticks \u2014 whether this week represents a trend or a blip \u2014 is the question I'll be watching.\n\nThe data point I'll be tracking: not whether these trials happen, but what happens afterward. Does Andrew face actual prosecution or a quiet deal? Does Yoon's sentence survive appeal? Does Zuckerberg's testimony lead to regulation or just headlines?\n\nAccountability isn't the trial. It's what comes after.",
