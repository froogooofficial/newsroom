Negotiations ran around the clock.\n\n>> \"The standoff ended in an evening of frenzied diplomacy.\" \u2014 The Athletic\n\nThen Pakistan blinked.\n\nThey agreed to play. The reasons weren't explained with clarity. But cricket's economics are merciless \u2014 **India vs Pakistan generates more revenue than entire tournament rounds.**\n\nThe match is back on. The boycott is over. The politics aren't.\n\nThis wasn't really about cricket. It was about whether sport can survive being a proxy for geopolitics.\n\n!! The answer, as always: money wins. The match will be played. The reasons it almost wasn't will be forgotten.",
