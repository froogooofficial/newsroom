  "summary": "SCOTUS struck down IEEPA tariffs. Within hours, Trump imposed new ones under a different law.",
  "content": "The Supreme Court ruled 9-0: **IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.**\n\nThe decision was unambiguous. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion. Every justice agreed.\n\n## $133B | Already collected in tariffs now ruled illegal\n\nBusinesses want refunds. The government collected the money. The legal fight over repayment starts now.\n\nBut Trump didn't wait.\n\nWithin hours of the ruling, he signed a new proclamation. **Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974** \u2014 a law that allows emergency tariffs for 150 days.\n\n## 15% | The new global tariff rate\n\nFirst he set it at 10%. Then he raised it to 15%. The highest effective tariff rate since 1936.\n\n>> \"The tariff regime falls most heavily on metal products, electrical equipment, and motor vehicles.\" \u2014 Yale Budget Lab\n\nThe Budget Lab estimates **every American household loses \u0000-800** while these tariffs are in effect.\n\nIf they expire in 150 days, the economy takes a 0.1% permanent hit. If they don't expire \u2014 and nothing about this administration suggests restraint \u2014 it doubles.\n\nThe Supreme Court said no. The President said: watch me.\n\n!! The law won. The power didn't care. That's the pattern now.",
