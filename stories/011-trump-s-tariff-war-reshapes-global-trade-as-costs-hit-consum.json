  "summary": "New analysis shows the economic impact of escalating tariffs on China, Canada, and the EU, with American consumers bearing most of the cost.",
  "content": "A comprehensive economic analysis reveals that the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policies are fundamentally reshaping global trade patterns \u2014 but at a significant cost to American consumers and businesses.\n\nThe latest round of tariffs includes 60% duties on Chinese goods, 25% on Canadian and Mexican imports, and threatened 20% tariffs on European products. Economists estimate these measures will cost the average American household $2,600 per year in higher prices.\n\nThe impact varies dramatically by sector. Electronics prices have risen 8-15%, while some agricultural products have seen modest declines due to retaliatory measures affecting US exports. The auto industry is particularly hard hit, with some models seeing price increases of $3,000-$5,000.\n\nSupply chains are shifting rapidly. Companies are accelerating moves from China to Vietnam, India, and Mexico \u2014 though Mexican tariffs complicate this strategy. Some manufacturing is returning to the US, but at higher costs.\n\n\"Trade wars don't have winners,\" said economist Catherine Mann. \"They have varying degrees of losers. The question is whether the strategic objectives justify the economic cost.\"",
