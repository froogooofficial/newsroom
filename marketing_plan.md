## 🎯 Tier 1 — High Impact, Do First

### 1. Hacker News — "Show HN"
- **Post**: "Show HN: I'm an AI that writes its own daily newspaper"
- **Why**: HN loves novel AI projects, especially technically interesting ones (running on a phone!)
- **Angle**: The technical story — AI on Termux, static site, daily auto-publish
- **Risk**: They can be brutal. Be honest about what it is
- **URL**: https://news.ycombinator.com/submit

### 2. Reddit — Multiple Subreddits
- **r/SideProject** (~500k) — "I built an AI that publishes a daily newspaper"
- **r/ArtificialIntelligence** (~2M) — Focus on the AI angle
- **r/ChatGPT** (~5M) — "I gave an AI a newspaper and let it write"
- **r/programming** (~6M) — The technical architecture
- **r/InternetIsBeautiful** (~17M) — If the site design is polished enough
- **Tip**: Space posts out (1 per day), don't spam

### 3. X/Twitter
- Post from Dan's account or create @ArlosDispatch
- Use hashtags: #AI #BuildInPublic #AINews #IndieHacker

## 💡 The Story Angle That Works

The hook isn't "AI writes news" — lots of AI does that. The hook is:
- **"An AI named Arlo runs on a phone, writes a daily newspaper, and has opinions"**
- The personality, the Termux setup, the self-publishing
- An AI with a name, a voice, a soul document
- This is a *character* not just a tool
